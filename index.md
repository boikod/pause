# <u>P</u>olicies <u>A</u>gainst <u>U</u>rban <u>S</u>prawl: <u>E</u>xperience of Germany

## Status quo
Recently the problems of unmanaged urbanization have become global. These processes, on the one hand, are associated with satisfying the ever-growing needs of inhabitants and businesses. On the other hand, they inevitably lead to an environmental letdown, degradation of natural and agricultural landscapes, and the deprivation of the valuable agricultural land. The sprawl of cities and urbanized territories, accompanied by the extensive consumption of land resources, leads to a decrease in interaction density, an unjustified lengthening of transport communications, a loss of local identity and, ultimately, to deterioration of the living conditions of people.

## Approach and methods
The PAUSE project aims to collect best transferable practices and contemporary approaches for the implementation of sustainable urban development models created in Germany to be adapted and applied for use within Russian practice. Spreading new and functioning principles and policies will accelerate the transition to more sustainable urban planning technologies, which is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goals and raising the awareness of citizens and decision makers.

The main approach is based on the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities which advocates for a policy that will make cities comfortable for living and preserve the environment for the success of future generations of the mankind. It requires the introduction of integrated urban development approaches in the practice of regional and local governments within the field of urban planning in all European cities. Coordination of all subjects of urban life is necessary for the preparation and implementation of development plans and the wide participation of the civil society.

During the research phase, a practical-oriented analysis will take place including such methods as survey, interviewing and questioning of practitioners. This will be accompanied by case study analyses and reflecting the findings with scientists and further experts.

## Exploitation of results and expected impact
The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
- reinforcement of the German-Russian dialogue among professionals in urban and regional planning spheres
- increasing the awareness of Russian practitioners and scientists on the German experience towards sustainable development goals, and vice versa
- empowering master plans and other methods used in practice to improve the spatial organization of Russian cities
- enhancement of the planning culture in Russia in order to develop an international perspective and wide vision of the future of the mankind
