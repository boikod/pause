Mkrtych Mkrtchyan, my colleague from Kherson, Ukraine, has taken an effort to translate the New Leipzig Charter into Russian ([download]({https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eWcQfNwVER9WNK_qZmvthwdNaMpQkPsn/view})).
Volunteer kind of translation was done because this newly revisited European Union's planning guidance is not going to be translated neither to Russian, nor to Ukrainian languages.
Although the translation sometimes is not as exact as it should be, this work is an outstanding example of the bottom-up bridge-building between two parts of the European continent.
At the same time, official Russian translation of the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning by UN Habitat ([download]({https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/04/ig-utp_russian.pdf})) do exist and are well-known among Russian professionals.
